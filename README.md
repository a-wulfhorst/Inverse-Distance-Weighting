# Inverse-Distance-Weighting
This is the code belonging to my bachelor thesis "Extensions of Inverse Distance Weighting for the Spatio-Temporal Interpolation and Smoothing of Precipitation Data". 

An overview of files: 
1. `Latex_rendering.ipynb` and `latex_support.py`: makes plots match Latex
2. 


The datasets were extracted from the DWD's Climate Data Center (CDC) at https://cdc.dwd.de/portal/202107291811/index.html. 

Spatial dataset (`275 Balderwang 1991 - 2020 daily`): OBS_DEU_P1D_RR (last access: 09/06/2021)
Temporal dataset (`DWD DE 1990 - 2019 monthly`): OBS_DEU_P1M_RR (last access: 07/12/2021)
